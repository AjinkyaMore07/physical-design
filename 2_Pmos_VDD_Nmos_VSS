Why PMOS called as pull up and NMOS called as pull down?


PMOS as Pull-Up, NMOS as Pull-Down: CMOS Inverter Example

Core Concept: The "pull-up" and "pull-down" terminology describes how PMOS and NMOS transistors influence the output voltage in a CMOS circuit (like an inverter) based on the input.

Example: CMOS Inverter (NOT Gate)

    Structure:
        PMOS: Top, connected to VDD (Supply Voltage) - forms the Pull-Up Network
        NMOS: Bottom, connected to GND (Ground) - forms the Pull-Down Network

    Assumptions (Example Values):
        VDD = 1.8V
        Vth,n (NMOS Threshold Voltage) = 0.4V
        Vth,p (PMOS Threshold Voltage) = -0.4V (Note: We use |Vth,p| for comparison)

Case 1: Input = 0V (Logic 0)

    NMOS Analysis:
        VGS,n = 0V - 0V = 0V
        0V < 0.4V => NMOS is OFF

    PMOS Analysis:
        VSG,p = 1.8V - 0V = 1.8V
        1.8V > 0.4V => PMOS is ON

    Result: PMOS pulls the output up to VDD. Vout = 1.8V (Logic 1)

Case 2: Input = 1.8V (Logic 1)

    NMOS Analysis:
        VGS,n = 1.8V - 0V = 1.8V
        1.8V > 0.4V => NMOS is ON

    PMOS Analysis:
        VSG,p = 1.8V - 1.8V = 0V
        0V < 0.4V => PMOS is OFF

    Result: NMOS pulls the output down to GND. Vout = 0V (Logic 0)

Why "Pull-Up" and "Pull-Down"?

    PMOS (Pull-Up): When the input is low (0V), PMOS turns ON and connects the output to VDD (pulling it high).
    NMOS (Pull-Down): When the input is high (1.8V), NMOS turns ON and connects the output to GND (pulling it low).

Key Equations (for understanding transistor behavior):

    NMOS ON: VGS,n > Vth,n
    PMOS ON: VSG,p > |Vth,p| (Important to use the absolute value of Vth,p)
    Drain-Source Voltage: VDS = VD - VS
    Current Flow:
        NMOS ON: Current flows from output to ground.
        PMOS ON: Current flows from VDD to output.

In essence, the names "pull-up" and "pull-down" directly reflect the direction in which the transistors drive the output voltage when they are in the ON state.
