ASIC Physical Design: Single Voltage vs. Multi Voltage

I. Overview:

    Single Voltage Design: Uses one power supply voltage for the entire chip.
    Multi Voltage Design: Employs different power supply voltages for different blocks/domains on the chip.

II. Comparison Table:
Feature 	                                        Single Voltage Design 	                                Multi Voltage Design
Definition 	                                Single power supply for entire chip. 	                  Multiple power supplies for different blocks.

Power Efficiency 	                    Less efficient (all blocks run at same voltage). 	        More efficient (blocks operate at required voltage, reduces power).

Complexity   	                              Simpler; Easier timing closure. 	                      More complex; Requires level shifters & isolation cells.

Design Overhead 	                        Lower design and verification effort. 	              Higher effort (voltage islands, isolation, power mode transitions).

Area & Routing 	                        Fewer power rails; Less routing congestion. 	              More routing for multiple power rails and level shifters.

Performance 	                                Uniform performance level. 	                     Selective high-performance regions; Optimize other parts for low power.

Use Cases 	                      Simpler designs; Power not a primary concern.                            Power-sensitive applications.
                                        (e.g., Basic microcontrollers, small ASICs). 	         (e.g., Mobile processors, SoCs, Battery-powered devices).

III. Key Challenges in Multi Voltage Design:

  1  Level Shifters:
        Required between voltage domains.
        Prevent signal integrity issues.

  2  Isolation Cells:
        Needed when a power domain is turned off.
        Prevent floating signals from causing issues in active domains.

  3  Power Routing Complexity:
        Multiple power rails.
        Increased congestion.
        Requires careful planning and routing strategies.

  4  Timing Closure Complexity:
        Different voltage levels affect signal delay.
        Requires multi-mode timing analysis to ensure correct operation across all voltage configurations.
