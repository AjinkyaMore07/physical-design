1. Physical-Only Cells
  These cells exist only in the layout and do not have a logical representation in the netlist. They do not have a Liberty (.lib) file since they do not contribute to timing or functionality.

    1]Filler cell 
        a) What is a Filler Cell?
          --> A filler cell is a special physical-only cell used in ASIC layout to fill empty spaces between standard cells. It does not have any logical function but helps in maintaining the continuity .

              
              A] Why are Filler Cells Needed?
                -->
                    To Maintain Diffusion and Well Continuity:
                        Standard cells contain n-wells, p-wells, and active diffusion regions. If there are gaps between standard cells, the continuity of these regions is broken, which can cause manufacturing defects.
                        Filler cells help bridge these gaps and ensure there is no discontinuity in the implant layers.
                
                    To Maintain Metal Connectivity for Power Rails (VDD/VSS):
                        In a digital design, power (VDD) and ground (VSS) rails run horizontally.
                        If there are gaps in standard cell rows, these rails might not be continuous, leading to power connectivity issues.
                        Filler cells contain metal layers that help in maintaining power connectivity.
                
                    To Avoid Design Rule Check (DRC) Violations:
                        Foundries have minimum spacing and continuity rules for diffusion, wells, and metal layers.
                        Gaps can cause DRC errors, and filler cells help meet these design rules.
